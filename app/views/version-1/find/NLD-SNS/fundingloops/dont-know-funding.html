 <p>That's fine don't worry, we are going to assume you don't pay the levy.</p>

  <p>This means your pay bill is less than £3 million. You pay 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice. We call this co-investment.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>agree a payment schedule with the training provider</li>
      <li>pay them directly for the training</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The government will pay the rest (90%) up to the <a href="">funding band maximum</a>. They’ll pay it directly to the training provider.</p>
        <p>As an employer you can get additional funding if you employ fewer than 50 employee.</p>
        <p>Other incentives payments include:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>taking on 16-18 year old apprentices</li>
      <li>employing apprentices who are care leavers</li>
      <li>employing apprentices who are on an educational and health-care plan</li>
    </ul>
